<p>If you're like <a href=http://twitter.com/arpith>me</a>, there are a bunch of blogs you read all the time. This is a way to keep track of them in one place, a fast and reliable replacement for Google Reader. Take a look at <a href=/arpith>the stuff I'm following</a> and see if you like the way <a href=/arpith/labels/read>articles are displayed</a>.</p>

<p>You are probably my target customer if you used Google Reader and loved it. I'm interested in having a buyer-seller relationship with you because it makes sense to pay a fee to access a service. It's also a sound business model: I charge users a fee, and try not to spend it all. However, if you don't mind getting an email or two asking for your feedback (or just want a free signup) email me at <a href=mailto:arpith@feedreader.co>arpith@feedreader.co</a> and I'll set you up with a free account.</p>

<p>I should probably also mention that there is an <a href=/api>api</a> that you can use to access your data.</p>
